# James Barnett
Hello, I'm James Barnett. I currently attend the University of Central Florida as an undergrad student learning software development

I recently made my github, so all of my future projects will be posted on here if you would like to take a look around. I mostly have
experience with C, but I also know Python, Java, C#, and have a little experience using TypeScript with SvelteKit.
